This repo contains my solutions to the problems in the book "Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures, Release 3.0" by Brad Miller and David Ranum.(https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci105ssc/resources/ProblemSolvingwithAlgorithmsandDataStructures.pdf)

The goal for the solutions is to be readable and pythonic, and as efficient as I can make them.
